# Thesis: A comparative study of Hybridized Neural Networks, in estimating traffic accident severity 
Dataset: https://data.gov.uk/dataset/6efe5505-941f-45bf-b576-4c1e09b579a1/road-traffic-accidents/datafile/89bf272f-c09f-4216-af7d-feb78ea94cbb/preview

In my thesis work, preprocessed the traffic accident severity dataset to fit in the several machine learning models such as Support vector machines (SVM), Random forest (RM), Naive Bias (NB), etc. As well as Hybridized Artificial neural network with Genetic algorithm(ANN-GA), Ann with principal component analysis (ANN-PCA), Ann with particle swarm optimization(ANN-PSO). These models overall gives us best performance.
